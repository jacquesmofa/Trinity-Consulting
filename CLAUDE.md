# CLAUDE.md: Trinity International Consulting Services (TICS)

Brampton/GTA consultancy since 2006: strategic planning, business consulting, grant writing, racial equity consulting, training.

- Live domain: tics-consulting.com (found in code; confirm)
- Host: ❓ not set up (no deploy workflow)
- Design and audience: see `brand-dna.md`. Placeholders: `PLACEHOLDERS.md` (create it when you find one).

## Studio rules (Jacques' web studio: apply to every task)
- This site must look custom-made for this client, never like a template. Never reuse another client's palette, font pairing, layout rhythm or signature element. No generic AI layout (centered hero + 3 icon cards + testimonial slider + CTA band) unless Jacques asks for it.
- Read `brand-dna.md` in this repo before any design or content change. Items marked ❓ are not confirmed: ask, don't invent.
- Real copy and real photos only. Never invent reviews, testimonials, statistics, people or partner logos. Every placeholder goes in `PLACEHOLDERS.md`.
- Done means: `npm ci && npm run build` passes, you checked desktop and mobile yourself, alt text, AA contrast, page titles/descriptions, compressed images.
- Push to the deploy branch only after the build passes and the change is verified (pushing deploys the live site). Never commit secrets.
- Report to Jacques in plain language, no jargon, with the live link. Anything he must do himself (secrets, DNS, accounts): click-by-click steps.
- Studio stack (zero recurring cost): client's own host via GitHub Actions FTP deploy; Cloudflare free in front; images in Cloudinary or the repo; video on YouTube or Mux (store the public Playback ID, never the Asset ID); forms via Web3Forms; editing via Pages CMS + Sveltia at `/admin`. No Vercel Hobby or Netlify for client sites.

## Stack and build
- Originally a Readdy export: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Router, i18next installed.
- Install and build: `npm ci && npm run build` → output in `out/`.
- Dev preview: `npm run dev`.
- Routes: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/services`, `/services/business-analysis`, `/services/business-registration`, `/services/capacity-building`, `/services/coaching-life-skills`, `/services/grant-writing`, `/services/job-search`, `/services/racial-social-equity`, `/services/sales-marketing`, `/services/seminars-conferences`, `/services/strategic-planning`, `/services/translation`, `/services/workshops-training`, `/why-us`.

## Deploy
- No deploy workflow. Add the studio FTP workflow once the host is known.

## Where things live
- Pages: `src/pages/<page>/` (one folder per page, sections in `components/`). Routes: `src/router/`.
- Text, images and links are mostly hard-coded inside the page components (`src/pages/<page>/components/*.tsx`).
- Next studio step for this site: move client-facing content into `src/content/*.json` and wire up both editors (Pages CMS + Sveltia at `/admin`), exactly like `jacquesmofa/CAWAP` (see its CLAUDE.md and `scripts/studio-tools/` for `extract.mjs`, `snapshot.mjs`, `compare.mjs`). Verify with before/after snapshots that visitors see no change.

## Known issues (found 10 Nov 2026)
- 69 Readdy AI placeholder image URLs (`readdy.ai/api/search-image`) are still in the code. Replace them with real photos and track the rest in `PLACEHOLDERS.md`.
- Some forms post to Readdy's form service (`readdy.ai/api/form`). Move them to Web3Forms with the client's email (studio standard) and test that a message actually arrives.
- Design overlap with other clients: Stock Tailwind blue + red: no brand identity yet.
